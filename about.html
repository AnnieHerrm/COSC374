                    <p>
                        Traditionally authentication involved using passwords and identity documents. The limitations involved with passwords are they can be forgotten or stolen. Biometric authentication provides enhanced security by including anatomical traits. Some examples include “fingerprint, face, palmprint, iris, and voice” (Biometric Authentication, Jain). Since biometric traits cannot be replicated and are linked with the individual, they provide excellent security. A biometric system first uses a sensor to obtain the data linked with the person. A sensor may include a fingerprint scanner or a facial recognition camera. Once the biometric sample is obtained, a software algorithm known as a “feature extractor”  (Biometric Authentication, Jain) can be used to extract unique characteristics and then be stored in a database. For authentication, the user provides a sample using the biometric sensor. After this, a query occurs which compares the sample with the data stored in the database. During the comparison, there is a numerical score that is calculated. Based on the algorithm, if the numerical score is equal to or greater than the acceptable value then the user is authenticated. Our project focuses on biometric security in vehicles. The risks involved with using biometric security and the advantages it has are highlighted. Our concept focuses on the additional security that multiple biometric checks have. It decreases the risk of breaking into the vehicle with only a small increase in the time to gain access to the vehicle.

                <h3>Intro</h3>
                    <p>
                        Biometric authentication appears as a highly secure method of verifying one's identity in today's digital age. Unlike traditional methods of authentication, such as passwords and PINs, which can be forgotten or stolen, biometric authentication relies on unique biological or behavioral traits that are virtually impossible to replicate. A biometric system first uses a sensor to obtain the data linked with the person. A sensor may include a fingerprint scanner, which traces ridges on the top part of the finger, or a facial recognition camera, which uses advanced software to extract certain facial features. Once the biometric sample is obtained, a software algorithm known as a “feature extractor”  (Biometric Authentication, Jain) can extract unique characteristics and store them in a database. For authentication, the user provides a sample using the biometric sensor. After this, a query occurs which compares the sample with the data stored in the database. During the comparison, there is a numerical score that is calculated. Based on the algorithm, if the numerical score is equal to or greater than the acceptable value, then the user is authenticated. This value is known as the threshold value.

                        Biometric authentication has been used throughout time and even dates as far back as the 14th century. Chinese merchants used ink to record and authenticate children's identities.  In the 1890s, the Bertillonge method was invented in France to help identify criminals, and the method quickly spread to other places around the world. This method included taking precise measurements of a criminal's limbs, sitting height, eye color, etc. (Weaver, 2006). From this, it was possible to narrow down potential suspects in crime cases. However, the Bertillonge method was outfaced a few decades later after an error in the method unfolded, and an innocent person was wrongly convicted at Scotland Yard. (Weaver, 2006). This incident exposed the limitations of relying solely on physical measurements for identification, resulting in a reevaluation of the method's accuracy and reliability in forensic investigations.

                        While the use of technology in vehicles continues to increase, it is important to create more efficient and better systems to protect vehicles from theft. Traditional security methods, like mechanical locks and keys, have proven vulnerable to break-ins. With biometric authentication, the reliance on physical keys is reduced or eliminated entirely. For this reason, most automotive companies started implementing biometric authentication, which uses biological evidence like fingerprint, face, or Iris detection to grant access to the vehicle. These sensors may be located on the door, and as a driver grabs the handle to open the door, they will place their finger on a fingerprint sensor, which in turn will unlock the vehicle. Not only does this make the vehicle more secure from auto theft, but it also enhances the user experience. Instead of carrying and using keys, the user can simply open the door since the vehicle will recognize the user.

                        With any invention, there are laws and regulations to be followed by governments worldwide, and the same applies to auto manufacturers when using and storing biometric data. This includes GDPR and CCPA, which give guidelines on how data is collected and, more importantly, how the data is stored. It is critical that the biometric data is stored securely. Additionally, there are organizations within the industry that exist solely to address and discuss the ethical aspects related to biometric authentication. For instance, ISO/IEC 19794 and NIST define guidelines for the formats in which biometric data can be stored.

                        While security should be the main focus, the behaviors of humans also play a role in whether or not a certain biometric is helpful for vehicles. This means that designing biometric systems with a user-centric focus involves intuitive interfaces and ergonomic considerations. For instance, if we look at the fingerprint on the car door handle again, it is very intuitive to use since when one opens a car door, they put their hand on the handle, but it would be very inconvenient to use it in the middle of winter when the car owner is wearing gloves which makes it very un-ergonomic. Furthermore, with traditional keys, a car owner could easily loan out their car to a friend or family member by simply giving the person their keys. But with biometric authentication, that friend or family member has to be programmed into the vehicle's database for approved persons, which might be time consuming.

                        Over time, human-to-machine interaction has become more and more intuitive, and humans are becoming more and more accustomed to using machines in their everyday lives. Nowadays, every person has a smartphone, which is vastly more intuitive to use than the early cell phones due to the touch screen. Gestures such as swipe, scroll, and zoom have made it very intuitive to make the machine, in this case, the phone, do as the user wishes. The same evolution is seen in vehicles; they went from having physical keys to unlock the doors, to remotes with lock and unlock buttons, to keyless entry, and now to fingerprint or other forms of biometric authentication. This all enhances the overall user experience and eliminates the hassle of carrying keys and the possibility of losing them.

                        Overall, biometric authentication can potentially change how we access our vehicles and keep them safe from theft. As the technology advances, it will be essential to address the accuracy of biometric authentication to ensure that it is used securely. This includes minimizing false positives or negatives, which would compromise security and, in the worst case, lead to an auto theft.

                    <p>
                        With centuries of development, biometric authentication has a long history and has become an essential part of contemporary security systems. This Thales Group article offers details on the development of biometric authentication over time. Ancient civilizations employed distinctive physical traits to identify people, and this is where the field of biometrics got its start. In economic transactions, for instance, the Babylonians used fingerprints on clay tablets as early as 2000 BC. Thumbprints were also employed in ancient China as a means of identification.
                        A cousin of Charles Darwin named Sir Francis Galton undertook groundbreaking study on fingerprints in the late 19th century, providing the groundwork for contemporary biometrics. Sir Edward Henry was influenced by his study and created the still-in-use fingerprint classification system. Biometrics made tremendous strides in the 20th century. The extensive use of fingerprinting for military personnel began during World War II. Facial recognition technology first appeared in the 1960s, though it was primitive by today's standards. During this time, voice recognition attracted interest as well. However, biometric authentication really took off in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. As fingerprint, iris, and hand geometry recognition technologies improved in usability and accuracy, more security systems began to incorporate them. The speed and precision of biometric matching were significantly enhanced by the advancement of computer algorithms and processing capacity. The 9/11 attacks sharpened the attention on security and prompted a rise in the use of biometrics in the government and aviation industries. For foreign travel, biometric passports—which incorporate fingerprint and facial recognition technology—have grown in popularity.
                        Today, biometric verification is essential to many facets of our life, including entering secure facilities, making financial transactions, and in some countries, even casting a ballot. Smartphones may now be unlocked using a fingerprint or facial recognition technology. Research into more complex biometric modalities like vein pattern recognition and DNA analysis is advancing the field further. In conclusion, the development of biometric authentication throughout history can be seen in everything from the primitive methods used by early civilizations to the cutting-edge innovations of the twenty-first century. Innovation, improved accuracy, and a rising role in boosting convenience and security in our digital environment have all been hallmarks of this path.

                        The article "Challenges and Opportunities of Biometric User Authentication in the Age of IoT: A Survey" investigates the complex connection between biometric authentication and the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT ecosystem offers promising potential for biometric authentication, including enhancing security through distinctive biological features and providing individualized, user-friendly experiences. But it also faces a number of difficulties. These difficulties include ensuring high reliability and accuracy, navigating complex regulatory compliance issues, optimizing resource-intensive biometric processes for resource-constrained devices, privacy concerns related to storing sensitive biometric data, and achieving interoperability among various IoT devices and authentication methods. This article explores these challenges, providing information on the state of biometric authentication in the Internet of Things today, prospective fixes, and real-world uses for biometric authentication that improve security and user ease.

                        The research project, "Identification, authentication, and tracking algorithm for vehicles using VIN in distributed VANET," marks a substantial advancement in the security and tracking capabilities of Distributed Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs). Real-time vehicle communication is made possible by VANETs, but to guarantee the network's security and dependability, reliable vehicle identification, authentication, and tracking systems are required.The suggested algorithm uses Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs), which are distinctive identifiers given to each vehicle during construction, to provide a ground-breaking technique. Each vehicle has a unique VIN, which functions as a digital fingerprint. The algorithm improves the accuracy and dependability of vehicle identification by including VINs into the authentication process.Because of this improved accuracy, nefarious actors trying to pose as cars or carry out fraudulent actions within the VANET face severe obstacles.
                        The algorithm's tracking abilities also make use of the natural association between VINs and specific automobiles. This makes it possible to track and monitor vehicle movements within the VANET effectively. Such tracking capabilities have considerable potential for use in managing traffic, planning routes, and preventing accidents, all of which will ultimately result in safer and more effective vehicular communication systems. In conclusion, the research in question represents a significant improvement in tackling significant difficulties in the developing connected car scenario. The algorithm not only strengthens the security and reliability of distributed VANETs but also opens up new opportunities for optimizing the operation of connected vehicles on our roads, promoting both safety and efficiency, thanks to its novel use of VINs for identification, authentication, and tracking.

                        The word biometric comes from the Greek words bios meaning life and metro meaning measure. Biometric authentication has two parts; biological statistics and authentication. Biological statistics means gathering data e.g. fingerprints and authentication means confirming that someone is authentic i.e. they are the correct person. Since every person has unique physical characteristics it can identify a person with greater precision than traditional ways (password, pins, etc.). This gives biometric authentication the advantage of being an unbreakable one-to-one relationship between a user and their information. Various techniques have been developed and have different use cases. This includes but is not limited to; face recognition, fingerprint, hand geometry, IRIS scan, keystrokes (typing on a keyboard), and voice recognition.

                    <p>
                        While biometric authentication offers a high degree of security it is far from perfect. This is because the assurance of a sound biometric system relies not only on the inclusion of biometrics but also on the hardware and software which might have bugs.</p>

                        With an increasing amount of auto theft, vehicle security is becoming more important. The proposed solution is a biometric dual authenticator; meaning both a traditional key and a biometric key should be present in order to start and operate a vehicle. The biometric used in the proposed system is a fingerprint reader as well as a GPS module which keeps track of its location for the owner to see. 
                        Here the fingerprint reader is wired into the ignition harness meaning the physical traditional key must be at the on position when the fingerprint is read. If the fingerprint is approved the power from the ignition will go to the starter and if not no power will be sent resulting in the car remaining off. The fingerprint reader has a database to accompany shared vehicles since they are rarely ever driven by the owner only. The database in the proposed solution can hold up to 200 fingerprints.
                        A drawback to this solution is that the owner of a vehicle is unable to merely give access to the vehicle to a friend, family member, or mechanic/technician in the same way traditional keys can be handed over.

                        In the digital age, identity theft (or digital impersonation) is becoming an increasing problem. Biometric techniques are being used as a hedge against such impersonations. The idea is that biometrics; physical characteristics and/or traits are far more reliable to correctly identify a person than traditional passwords. 
                        Once a biometric has been recorded the sample is reduced to a mathematical template (256 bytes for a fingerprint and 512 bytes for an iris scan). This reduces the risk of a replay attack where someone steals biometric data and replays to impersonate another individual without that individual physically being present. 
                        A match between the enrolled sample (stored) and the bid sample should not be expected to be 100%. Instead, the match is evaluated on the Hamming distance which is the difference between the enrolled sample and the bid sample. The acceptance of the distance is a probabilistic concept but two major characteristics should be considered; false acceptance rate and false rejection rate. False acceptance rate is desired to be very low and the false rejection rate should be low enough that a user does not give up in frustration.

                        This article goes over quite a bit of the history and development of facial recognition technology. The strides it has made and the problems it has faced during its history. Before having a proper analysis the technology usually uses the principal component analysis to get the most important parts of the facial data and get rid of redundant information. Then there is a Support Vector Machine which uses facial features as training data to distinguish between the faces it is trained on.The ADABOOST is a boosting algorithm that helps make it so weaker classifier that have good classification have more say in being used so that isn’t just strong classifiers being considered regardless of how good they are. But one issue of this technology that it faces is the small sample data it uses for facial recognition; however there are proposals for new survey methods to help fix this problem. Another algorithm they use is neural networks to replicate the function of a human brain so the technology can use our own facial recognition functions for better results. Facial recognition was also greatly improved with deep learning which is a branch of machine learning where the algorithm can find features for classification during the training process so that it can even learn to recognize facial features from low quality images of faces. A major factor that affects facial recognition and is still a factor that is hard to work around which is non-ideal positions for facial recognition such as posture can affect how a person’s face looks. Facial recognition has a long way to go and it faces many issues outside of the technology but there is the potential to improve everything involved such as 3D technology to recognize 2D images</p>
                    <p>
                        Facial recognition is best used to recognize faces from 2D images that were taken in optimal and controlled environments which leaves faces within a real world scenario a tricky subject to handle with facial recognition. Expression, body-orientation, and lighting can cause some issues with the software system trying to gather information based on facial expressions presented to it. So this article goes over a method to help facial recognition be trained for more real-world scenarios of faces to process, which also allows for a system that requires only a small dataset, is accurate, and also works efficiently. One part is that it employs an automatic face alignment system, this uses scanned landmarks on the face, usually around the eyes, nose, and mouth, to help create a face mesh that helps it match whatever face it is going to reference. For facial recognition, it employs a modified Robust Sparse Coding algorithm to have the training images in a matrix and the system can efficiently and accurately find the matching face that was previously scanned and altered for the face mesh. With well-aligned images, this algorithm was able to achieve a stunning 95% accuracy for recognition. The article goes over an experiment to further show how well this works with 3 experiments with a few random images that were not created in a controlled environment. With each experiment, the algorithm showed signs of both improved facial recognition and computing time for each image. Even based on a single unique image for one image the algorithm was able to show good results with a best of 30% accuracy for the face recognition which is quite good for the lowest possible training data set and with this scenario it is a very unlikely scenario to only have one unique picture for a person. But it is a scenario that needs to be tested and the results show how well the algorithm was able to handle it. Thus with the typical data set of around 10 images, the experiment showed the methods outlined in the article were proven to be twice as accurate as other popular methods with even half the computing time allowing for face recognition to be used in real time with an impressive amount of accuracy.

                        With the rise of artificial intelligence being able to generate images possibly based on real people there are questions and concerns about this being used as a face to get around biometric security such as face recognition or voice recognition. Deep Fake images of people’s faces and voices have shown up to become scarily accurate with even being used for scam calls but can possibly be used to fool biometric security which potentially leaves a new opening for hackers to access organization servers and databases. Educated voices on the subject talk about what do need or not worry about with generative artificial intelligence. One of the issues addressed with biometric security is that biometric “keys'' cannot be redone the same way a password can. When a password is compromised you can recreate a new password but when a thumbprint or face is recreated there is no way to just get a new thumbprint or use a new face. Without live detection, the progress of this artificial intelligence can allow for people to pretend to be someone else or get through barriers without being detected by the system until damage has been done and normal hacking defenses or methods will likely not be able to deal with such events.
                        Countries such as South Korea are looking into researching these types of AI so that they can have guidelines for updating or creating new lines to deal with these potential breaches of biometric security. Australia has already moved on to considering creating a law to ban what could be considered uses of artificial intelligence that are “high-risk” for security such as deep fakes. The European Union has been continuously working on creating frameworks for what people can and can’t do with generative artificial intelligence so that the technology can be used but there are rules in place that prevent or punish malicious uses of this technology. Professionals will work towards legal terms of AI and laws around it, standards for AI and managing risk, and also observing existing and emerging concerns about generative AI being used to circumvent biometric security.

                        The article “A Study of Biometric Approach for Vehicle Security System Using Fingerprint Recognition” by Kiruthiga and Latha(2014), is a literature survey that emphasizes major approaches for vehicle security systems that use person identification techniques.  Person Identification techniques are classified into three categories, knowledge-based like passwords, token-based like keys, and biometric-based like fingerprints, and with the danger of being stolen or lost for the first two categories, biometric-based identification is more secure and more efficient to be used. Fingerprint biometrics is one of the most essential biometric technologies because it is efficient, secure, easy to use, and has lower error rates than other biometric systems. There are two types of fingerprint systems, fingerprint verification (one-to-one matching) which accepts or rejects the person's claimed identity, and fingerprint identification (many-to-one matching) which scans the person’s fingerprints against all registered users. Fingerprint verification systems consist of 4 main modules which are fingerprint sensing, pre-processing, feature extraction, and fingerprint matching. The article presented some related work for vehicle security systems using fingerprint recognition technology such as RFID, ECU, video surveillance, and GPS, and it discussed their limitations and drawbacks. Finally, The article proposes a low-cost, reliable vehicle security system based on fingerprint recognition, and it consists of a PIC microcontroller, LCD display, GSM module, and fingerprint scanner. The system allows the user three trials and if the scan matches access will be given, but if the three trials fail, the alarm system will be activated, and an alert message will be sent to the vehicle’s owner and in case of a network error another alert message will be sent to the nearest police station.</p>

                        The article “Privacy-Preserving Biometric Authentication: Challenges and Directions” by Pagnin and Mitrokosta(2017), talks about the main challenges and solutions for the design of biometric authentication systems. The security method called Biometric authentication uses an individual’s unique physical or behavioral traits such as fingerprints, voice, iris, or signature to confirm their identity. The two main stages that Biometric authentication goes through are the enrollment stage, where the user registers their biometric template to the system, and the authentication stage where the user provides a new biometric trait and the system performs matching to accept or reject the user. The article describes the difference between classical authentication systems which have no security measures to protect the biometric templates of the users, and privacy-preserving biometric authentication systems which have security measures such as encryption to protect the user’s biometric templates against both passive and active attacks. There are four types of threats against the privacy and security of these systems and those threats are biometric sample recovery, biometric reference recovery, user traceability, and user distinguishability. The article’s last section discusses the main challenges and countermeasures for privacy-preserving biometric authentication systems. The challenges consist of preventing impersonating attacks, making biometric templates irrevocable, and ensuring the privacy of personal information. The countermeasures consist of error correction methods, biometric template protection, cryptographic primitives, and other non cryptographic methods.</p>
                    <p>
                        Biometric authentication uses a person's physical traits for authentication. This method of authentication is more secure than traditional methods of authentication such as passwords. One concern is if there is an unauthorized release of a person’s stored biometric data then an unauthorized individual can get into a user's account. An adversary can obtain the biometric data by attacking the system infrastructure or from insiders within the company. Examples of attacks on the system include trojan horse, man-in-the-middle and replay. The end result of any method of attack on biometric authentication would be denial of service and intrusion. Another problem with biometric authentication is if the data is stolen, then it is not possible to have new biometric data for an individual because it’s irreversible. Because of this, it is important to keep the data secure. 
                        A solution to keeping biometric data secure is using a biometric template protection scheme. The biometric templates must have three requirements. First is non-invertibility which means it is computationally difficult to recover biometric features from a stored template. The second requirement is discriminability which protects the accuracy of the biometric system authentication. Lastly, another requirement is revocability. Revocability allows the creation of multiple secure templates from the same biometric data. So if the template became compromised the biometric system can revoke the old template and reissue a new one. 
                        There are two ways to secure biometric templates. One is biometric feature transformation which provides a one way or noninvertible transformation function to the original template. During authentication the same transformation function is applied on a biometric query. If there is a match between the query and template then the user is authenticated. The second way to secure templates is by using biometric cryptosystems. The cryptosystem uses a key to generate a secure sketch which only stores a fraction of the information from the biometric template. The secure sketch has enough information to recover the biometric template with another biometric sample. Then the biometric template and key can be used to check if there is a match in the database. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are two modes that can be used with biometric systems. One mode is identity verification, also called one-to-one authentication. During identity verification the user knows that he is already in the system. During the authentication the biometric data is obtained and then compared with the data located in the database. Another mode of biometric systems is Identification which is when the user is unknown. Once the biometric data is obtained it is compared with all the records in the database. 
                        The performance of biometric authentication can vary based on what type of characteristics are used. Two types of characteristics are genotypic characteristics and phenotypic characteristics. Genotypic characteristics don’t change over time and are resistant to false rejection rates. The downside to using genotypic characteristics is that they are identical for twins. An alternative would be using phenotypic characteristics but they change over time. Also using phenotypic characteristics can increase the likelihood of a false acceptance. Another characteristic to consider in a biometric system algorithm is within-subject variability and between subject variability. If within-subject variability must accept similar biometric samples from the same person. If within subject variability is too high then there is a chance for increased false rejections. Between-subject variability needs to be at an optimal level. If it is too low then two people will look the same and there will be a false acceptance. A biometric system for vehicle security can implement identity verification because the user is registered in the system. When creating a biometric authentication system, a decision needs to be made whether to use phenotypic or genotypic characteristics. Both have their pros and cons. Another aspect to set for the algorithm is between subject and within subject variability. 
                        Liveness is a criteria used to keep biometric authentication secure. It will distinguish whether data is stolen or if it is fresh and originating from the actual person. Static liveness tests will measure a physiological characteristic like finger temperature. This will help the biometric system from distinguishing a living human and an artificial fake fingerprint. A dynamic tests checks for a reaction of a person from an impulse. One example of this is increasing the intensity of light to measure pupil dilation.

                        Biometrics are seen as something of use in the modern age, but their use and application go back many years, even centuries to ancient times. Biometric identifiers can be divided into two different types: physiological and behavioral. Examples of physiological biometrics include fingerprints, face recognition, DNA, palmprints, hand geometry, iris recognition, and odor. Behavioral examples include typing rhythm, gait, and voice. Each type is characterized by its own history of development as well as its own implementation, with some being preferred over others for various reasons. The primary purpose of using biometrics is for establishing security, to assure that authentication of individuals can be assured to a high degree for applications that are private and sensitive to users. Biometrics should have certain properties in order to be effective. For one it should establish universality, or something that all people have as well as exhibit uniqueness, something that separates each person from one another. It needs to be measurable, i.e., something that can be easily collected and analyzed, in addition to providing performance with its speed and accuracy. It also needs to be accepted by the people as an appropriate form of analysis and not deemed invasive or harmful. Above all, for the primary goal of security, it must not be easily circumvented; that is, it cannot be easy to fool the system.

                        For purposes of this project, we look at fingerprinting and facial recognition. Fingerprinting is one of the oldest and popular biometric methods that provides a lot of details about a person. When looking at fingerprints, we look at a person’s papillary pattern, which is unique to the person. The beginning and ending of lines, the merging/separating, bends and breaks, ridges are all unique among billions of different possible fingerprints. Fingerprints provide not only uniqueness but also stability, as age and damage do not permanently alter the prints (if damaged, unique pattern restored). Types of papillary patterns that are examined for individuals include the arch papillary pattern, the loop papillary pattern, and the whorl. The loop is the most popular pattern, with nearly 2/3 of people having this type of pattern, with the whorl being second, and the arch being third most popular. In today’s modern biometrics there are also touchless fingerprint scanners as well as 3D fingerprint scanners that add layers of uniqueness to the biometric database, as well improve the portability of this data.
                        Facial recognition is also a biometric method with a long history, though it has fallen out of favor due to dependence on light, resolution, facial expressions, etc. There are 2D and 3D facial recognition applications that try to perform the four same functions: detect the face, normalize it by identifying facial landmarks, extraction from a database, and recognition by matching. With facial recognition, faces are subjected to change over time and do not offer the sort of permanence that a fingerprint can with respect to papillary patterns, as it relies on distances between eyes, widths of noses, length of jawlines, all of which can change with age or damage/reconstruction. Facial recognition requires more updating than fingerprinting, but is nonetheless a biometric tool that can be employed.

                        With the various types of biometrics out there to be used for a myriad of purposes, there come advantages and disadvantages. Advantages include providing high security and assurance, positive user experiences, non-transferable measurements, and being spoof-proof. High security and assurance mean that biometrics provide a higher level of authentication than passwords and PINs can, with the latter being easily compromised or forgotten by the user requiring updating and reverification. Users can be assured that only they are accessing their biometric required applications. The user experience with biometrics is fast and efficient, while providing a high level of security. Sometimes efficiency is sacrificed for security, but with biometrics that is typically not the case. The biometric data is not transferable the way a password is, as it requires physical presence with a physical application. Additionally, it is much more difficult to replicate; you have a 1/64 billion chance of your fingerprint matching exactly with someone else’s, which is lower odds of winning the lottery than having the same fingerprint as a fraudster.
                        Disadvantages on the other hand include the costs, data breaches, tracking, bias, and false positives. Advanced security systems using biometrics require significant investments and costs to put in place, and IT professionals cite cost as the biggest reason for organizations not electing to use biometrics. Data breaches are more commonplace these days, and with breaches of physiological and behavioral data that data is locked and cannot be changed the way passwords can. There is also a concern of privacy being compromised by surveillance systems that can use biometrics for nefarious purposes such as tracking someone with reason and without their knowledge. Additionally, there are concerns of bias, as those who don’t have access to expensive biometric collecting may not then have access to the same resources and services such as those needed for credit. Also, the fear of false positives as methods that scan only partial prints for efficiency may lead to corrupted authentication.

                        Biometric methods are more and more becoming a part of the automobile design process. Biometrics are seen as ways to improve vehicular security, increase accessibility, improve safety, and enhance the overall driver experience. They are changing the way drivers interact with cars, and today there are several biometrics that are used in the vehicular experience. Fingerprint scanners have been put into some models, such as some Hyundai vehicles in the 2018 rollout. Hyundai has also patented and released iris and retina scanners, which present a user uniqueness like fingerprints do. Hyundai and Genesis have also their own versions of facial recognition they have featured for future release, that would operate for the same purpose as fingerprint and retinal scanners. As far as technology of the future is concerned, methods to incorporate artificial intelligence with user biometrics are underway. For example, a driver can register biometrics such as facial recognition and heartbeat, and based on those metrics the artificial intelligence can then adjust the driving experience (speed of car, lighting, etc.) to soothe the driver. Artificial intelligence can also monitor the driver for fatigue and intoxication, then helping with car safety by alerting the driver or calling for assistance.

                        The advent of biometric security systems in modern vehicles has marked a significant shift away from traditional key-based security approaches. Biometric features, including facial recognition and fingerprint scanning, offer both convenience and advanced security. These innovations not only streamline the access process but also enhance security, reducing the risk of unauthorized vehicle access. However, as with any technology, there are potential risks and limitations. In this paper, we delve into the dangers of relying solely on biometric security in vehicles, the concept of partial fingerprint scanning, and the necessity of implementing multiple checks, including PINs, to bolster vehicle security.

                        Biometric security has found its way into various sectors, including vehicle access. Biometric systems in cars can include facial recognition technology and fingerprint scanners. While these advancements offer convenient and sophisticated security measures, they are not without their vulnerabilities. The exclusive reliance on these biometric methods can lead to potential security risks, making it crucial to consider additional layers of protection.

                        Facial recognition technology has made significant progress in recent years, with widespread adoption in smartphones and other devices. However, it is far from infallible. Factors such as ambient lighting conditions and changes in an individual's appearance, like the presence of facial hair or the use of glasses, can impact the accuracy of facial recognition systems. Moreover, these systems are susceptible to biometric spoofing, where high-resolution photos or masks can deceive the technology. A study by Ngan (2020) demonstrated the vulnerability of facial recognition to high-quality photos used for unauthorized access. This highlights the technology's susceptibility to fraud and underscores the need for supplementary security measures to reinforce its reliability.

                        Fingerprint scanning, another prevalent biometric feature in vehicle security, is typically implemented as partial fingerprint scans rather than scanning the entire fingerprint. Although partial scanning is faster and more convenient, it raises concerns regarding security. The increased likelihood of false positives and susceptibility to spoofing attempts using fingerprint replicas or gels may compromise the system's reliability (Li et al., 2018).

                    <p>
                        A research study by Li and colleagues (2018) emphasized the potential of partial fingerprint scans to produce false positives, leading to unauthorized access. This research also demonstrated the vulnerability of partial fingerprint scans to spoofing attacks, where high-quality replicas could deceive the system. These findings emphasize the need for supplementary security measures, such as PINs, to enhance the overall security of the vehicle.

                        Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) have a well-established history in security systems and play a fundamental role in adding an extra layer of protection. Typically, only the authorized user knows the PIN, making it a robust form of authentication. In a vehicle security context, combining biometric scans with a PIN introduces an additional barrier for unauthorized access (Woo & Cho, 2018).</p>
                    <p>
                        Woo and Cho (2018) found that the combination of biometric verification and PINs significantly enhanced the security of access control systems. The presence of a PIN alongside biometric data reinforced the system's reliability and reduced the risk of unauthorized access, making it a practical solution for vehicle security.

                    <p>
                        The integration of biometrics and PINs creates a two-factor authentication system. Even if someone manages to bypass the biometric scan, they would still need to know the correct PIN to gain access to the vehicle. This approach significantly enhances security and mitigates the dangers of relying solely on biometrics (Xu et al., 2021). Xu and colleagues (2021) conducted a comprehensive study on the benefits of combining biometrics and PINs. The research confirmed that this approach added a robust layer of security and was effective in preventing unauthorized access attempts. The results highlighted the potential of multi-factor authentication systems in enhancing the overall security of vehicles.

                        A critical factor in ensuring vehicle security is the active engagement of users in the verification process. Many biometric systems, especially facial recognition, may fail when users are not adequately engaged or are passively cooperating. In such cases, an individual who gains physical access to the vehicle can open it without encountering any security checks. This underscores the necessity for proactive verification, which emphasizes active participation by the user (Lee et al., 2019). Research by Lee and his team (2019) highlighted the importance of active verification in biometric security systems. The study demonstrated that user cooperation and active participation significantly improved the reliability of the system. Understanding the importance of actively carrying out the verification process is critical to strengthening vehicle security.

                    <p>
                        To maximize the effectiveness of security checks, it is crucial to educate users on the importance of actively participating in the verification process. Users should be aware that the security system's reliability depends on their cooperation. Training and user awareness campaigns are essential components of vehicle security. Ensuring that users understand and adhere to best practices is vital in maintaining the integrity of the security system (Kwon et al., 2021). Kwon and his team (2021) conducted a comprehensive user education and training program, emphasizing the significance of active participation in the verification process. The study revealed that informed and trained users were more likely to actively engage with the security system, thereby enhancing its effectiveness in preventing unauthorized access. In conclusion, the reliance on biometric security systems in vehicles, such as facial recognition and partial fingerprint scanning, presents inherent vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities arise from factors such as changes in ambient lighting conditions, alterations in an individual's appearance, and the susceptibility to biometric spoofing. Furthermore, the partial scanning of fingerprints, rather than complete fingerprint scans, adds complexity to the security landscape, potentially leading to false positives and susceptibility to spoofing.

                    <p>
                        To address these vulnerabilities and strengthen vehicle security, a multi-faceted approach is necessary. The integration of Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) with biometric scans provides an additional layer of protection. PINs have a proven track record in access control, and when used in conjunction with biometrics, they significantly enhance the security of vehicle access. The combination of what the user knows (PIN) and what the user is (biometric) creates a robust two-factor authentication system, making unauthorized access significantly more challenging. However, even with these measures in place, user engagement is crucial. The importance of actively participating in the verification process cannot be overstated. Users must understand that the effectiveness of the security system is contingent on their cooperation. Without user engagement, the security checks may become less reliable, potentially compromising the overall security of the vehicle. Therefore, user education and training are vital components of an effective security strategy. Users need to be aware of the significance of actively participating in the verification process and understand the potential risks associated with complacency.

                        Educational programs and awareness campaigns can play a pivotal role in ensuring that users adhere to best practices and actively engage with the security system. In an ever-evolving security landscape, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of biometric security systems in vehicles. While they offer convenience and advanced security features, they are not without vulnerabilities. By combining biometrics with PINs and emphasizing user participation, we can enhance the overall safety of vehicles, effectively protecting individuals and their valuable assets. This comprehensive approach addresses the dangers of exclusive biometric security, making it a more reliable option for safeguarding vehicles.

                        In an era marked by the proliferation of connected vehicles, the need for robust security measures cannot be overstated. Vehicles are no longer mere modes of transportation; they are data-rich computers on wheels, teeming with sensitive information about their owners, their routes, and even their driving habits. Consequently, the implications of a security breach go far beyond vehicle theft. Unauthorized access to a vehicle could provide hackers with a gateway to personal data, a potential safety risk on the road, and even a means to compromise critical systems within the vehicle. As such, a multi-factor authentication approach, which combines the strength of biometrics with the reliability of PINs, becomes an imperative step towards fortifying the security of modern vehicles. Moreover, the security landscape is dynamic, constantly evolving as both malicious actors and technology developers seek innovative solutions. The integration of biometric security systems into vehicles has paved the way for a more secure and convenient driving experience. Yet, this progress must be complemented by the ongoing refinement of security protocols.

                        The industry must remain vigilant, continuously addressing emerging vulnerabilities and advancing security measures to stay ahead of potential threats. While biometric authentication and PINs are crucial today, they should be seen as part of an ever-evolving security strategy. Researchers and industry experts must collaborate to develop and adapt security technologies to meet the challenges of tomorrow. In conclusion, the use of biometric security in vehicles is undoubtedly a significant step towards enhancing vehicle security. Still, it is vital to recognize its limitations and vulnerabilities, necessitating the adoption of multi-factor authentication that includes PINs. By actively engaging users in the verification process and providing adequate education and training, vehicle security can be significantly improved. In an environment where technology continually advances and security threats evolve, the integration of these complementary security measures is critical to safeguarding not only the vehicles themselves but the wealth of data they contain, ensuring that our vehicles remain safe, secure, and reliable in an increasingly connected world.

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        As shown in the sections above the concept of biometric authentication security for vehicles is a very novel one and shows that it can be quite useful, convenient, and secure compared to the traditional method of using a key. Access to the vehicle will require a facial scan or fingerprint scan to verify that the vehicle belongs to them, this will hopefully turn away and keep out any malicious third-party who wishes to access the vehicle for whatever reason. However, there are still some security issues with just using biometric authentication by itself such as the use of ways to use someone’s face through other means such as a high quality picture or even an AI generated picture based on a person. Partial fingerprint scans have also shown to lead to false positives which allows for a person to access with their own fingerprint because the system views it as close enough to the verified user’s fingerprint. So biometric authentication can not be the sole passive defense to protect the security of the vehicle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Within our concept, we present the idea that another form of authentication that can work alongside biometric authentication is implementing a PIN code that needs to be imputed to access the vehicle. This creates a two-factor authentication system where the user must present who they are and also present what they know. So a malicious third-party must somehow have a way to authenticate the biometric data and also input the right information for the PIN code in order to access the vehicle. This is a significant increase in security that keeps most of the convenience and hopefully the strength of the biometric system while also delivering an extra layer of security that the verified user will keep in mind so that their vehicle is safe and secure. No key to carry around is required to enter the vehicle but instead they just need to present their face or fingerprint and then input the PIN code to access the vehicle. With this concept in mind the ever evolving security landscape has a good solution to the implementation of biometric authentication for vehicle security and the two-factor authentication aspect which should keep locks close to airtight from even the most adamant of criminals who wish to access that particular vehicle.
